# What's this all about?
This site is a digital space to remember and learn about General Liao Yaoxiang (廖耀湘). It’s a place where I'm gathering his own writings, articles from people who knew him, and other interesting historical notes. The photos are kept on a separate site where they can be tagged with names, years, and locations to make them easy to find.

# 这网站是做什么的？
这个网站是用来纪念和了解廖耀湘将军（Liao Yaoxiang）的数字空间。在这里收集了他本人的文章、熟人写的纪念短文以及其他一些相关的历史资料。照片存放在另一个网站，这样就可以用姓名、年份和地点来给照片打上标签，方便查找。

# Why did I make this?
Honestly, finding all this information was a real challenge. I decided to put everything in one place to help with my own research and thought it would be great to share it with anyone else who's interested in General Liao Yaoxiang's story.

# 我为什么建这个网站？
说实话，搜集这些信息还挺折腾的。我决定把所有东西都放在一个地方，方便自己研究，也觉得可以分享给其他对廖将军的故事感兴趣的朋友们。
