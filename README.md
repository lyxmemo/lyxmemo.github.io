# What's this all about?
This site is a digital space to remember and learn about General Liao Yaoxiang (廖耀湘). It’s a place where I'm gathering his own writings, articles from people who knew him, and other interesting historical notes. The photos are kept on a separate site where they can be tagged with names, years, and locations to make them easy to find.

# 这网站是做什么的？
这个网站是用来纪念和了解廖耀湘将军（Liao Yaoxiang）的数字空间。在这里收集了他本人的文章、亲友的纪念文以及其他一些相关的历史资料。

# Why did I make this?
Honestly, finding all this information was a real challenge. I decided to put everything in one place to help with my own research and thought it would be great to share it with anyone else who's interested in General Liao Yaoxiang's story.

# 为什么建这个网站？
许多史料首先不容易找到，其次是竖版繁体，客观上为许多爱好者创造了困难。为了方便我自己，也为了更多的人能够认识和了解廖耀湘将军，降低传播门槛，故此把资料都放在这里。
