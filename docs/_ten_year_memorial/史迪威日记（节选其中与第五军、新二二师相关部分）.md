> Talk with Chiang K'ai-shek. Lecture about Chinese temperament and limitations. Why they can't attack. What they will do. Won't retreat until ordered out, etc., etc. But defeat in Burma would be disastrous shock to morale. Fifth and Sixth [are] "cream of Army." Must be careful, etc., etc. I put up a stout plea to use the British as far as possible, and not expose Chiang K'ai-shek to criticism by reneging on his commitments. He had a lot of good sense in his talk. Importance of making good-first foreigner to handle Chinese troops. Impression made on these troops will make or break me. Must look to future. I repeated instructions and went over all the points he had made. Look at it coldly, and the Chinese are doing a big thing from their point of view in handing over this force to a lao mao-tzu [old hat] they don't know very well. It must be a wrench for them, and they should be given due credit, in spite of all the restrictions they have put on me.
> 22nd and 96th Divisions (of Fifth Army) edge in when chow is provided. Sixth Army stays put. Hold Toungoo- Prome line till British leave Prone. Then back to T'hazi line. Hold at Thazi and concentrate for counterattack.

> 同蒋介石谈话。蒋大谈中国人的气质和他们所受到的约束；他们不能进攻的理由；他们想要做什么；除非接到撤出的命令，否则他们不会这样做，等等，等等。但是在缅甸的失败对于士气将是灾难性的一击。第五军和第六军是“军队中的精华”。必须慎重，等等，等等。我态度异常坚决地请求尽可能地利用英国人。他在谈话中判断敏锐。他知道这次行动的成败事关重大——一个外国人第一次指挥中国军队。给这些军队留下的印象将使我或是成功，或是毁灭。必须面向未来。我把他说的要点都重复了一遍。用客观的观点来看这件事，中国人把军队交给一个他们并不十分熟悉的外国人，是做了一件了不起的大事。这对他们来说肯定是十分痛苦的，尽管他们对我进行种种限制，但他们应当得到本应得到的称赞。

> 得到食品供应后，（第五军的）第22师和第96师缓慢地开了进去。第六军留在原地未动。在英国人离开眉谬之前要一直据守东吁一眉谬一线。然后回到达西一线。守住达西，集结力量准备反攻。

> When Stilwell arrived in Burma to assume combat duties in March he found a country whose civil population, both rear and front, festered with discontent and treachery.
> The strategy of the entire Burma campaign spun itself about the north-south railway line that ran three hundred miles from Rangoon to Mandalay, and then in meter gauge, two hundred fifty miles more to Myitkyina. Some- where in central Burma the Allies hoped to establish a front cutting from east to west across the railway, where the Japanese might be held. Meanwhile the actual line of combat was some hundred miles north of Rangoon, running east and west for roughly one hundred miles. This front was being pushed north by the Japanese, but the Allies were trying to shield the railway as they withdrew to keep retreat from degenerating into a rout over pathless mountains and jungles.
> The western end of the front (nearest India) was held by the British at Prome. The center, at Toungoo directly on the railway, was held by the Chinese 200th Division, the eastern end (nearest Thailand) was held by the British again. The forces at Stilwell's command consisted of the following:
> * Chinese Fifth Army (Commander: Tu Yü-ming) which in turn commanded the 200th Division(Tai), 22nd Division (Liao), goth Division (Yu), and the 38th Division(Sun)
> * Chinese Sixth Army (Commander: Kan Li-ch'u) which in turn commanded the 55th Division(Chen), 28th Division (?) and the 49th Division (?)
>
> The 200th Division was in the line. The rest of the Fifth Army was in north Burma several hundred miles to the rear. The Sixth Army was disposed along the border of China and Thailand.
> The Japanese in their swift drive north had almost encircled the 200th division (Chinese) at Toungoo in the center. But in so doing they had also exposed themselves, and Stilwell saw an opportunity for a counterattack. As commander in chief of the Burma Expeditionary Forces of the Chinese Armies he wanted to concentrate his forces at Pyinmana on the railway 60 miles north of the front. He wanted particularly to bring down the 22nd and g6th Divisions of General Tu Yü-ming's Fifth Army from the north, where they were useless, to the Pyinmana area, where they could rescue the 200th Division. Scattered across Burma, the Chinese divisions would be destroyed one by one-concentrated and used in battle, they might check the Japanese advance. It might even be possible to recapture Rangoon and reopen the port.
> The plan depended on two things: the ability of the British to hold the western flank at Prome and the swiftness and diligence of the Chinese in moving to execute orders for a counterattack.
> To the Chinese, however, concentration of divisions in the battle zone for a counterattack meant not a multiplication of opportunity, but a multiplication of risk of loss. Reluctance to attack seemed to drench the spirit of the Chinese command beyond any measure of encouragement Stilwell could give. In the course of the next two weeks Stilwell found that his authority to command was an authority of courtesy, not an authority of action. He decided then to fly back to Chungking and discuss the matter with Chiang K'ai- shek.

> 3月，当史迪威到达缅甸，承担起指挥作战的职责时，他发现这个国家无论是在后方还是前方，由于普通老百姓的不满和背叛，状况变得越来越糟。
> 整个缅甸战役是围绕着贯穿缅甸南北的铁路线进行的。这条铁路线从仰光至曼德勒，有300英里长，此后是1米的窄轨，再走250英里到达密支那。盟军希望在缅甸中部的某个地方建立一条战线，从东向西横跨铁路线摆开，以此阻止住日军。当时实际的战线在仰光以北大约100英里处，从东到西宽约100英里。这条战线正在被日军推向北面，但盟军在撤退时力图保住铁路，以免在撤退时穿越无路可走的山地和丛林。
> 战线的西端（离印度最近的地方）由驻眉谬的英军据守。战线中部的东吁在铁路线上，由中国的第200师扼守，东端（离泰国最近的地方）也是由英军防守。
> 归史迪威指挥的部队如下：
> * 中国的第五军（指挥官：杜聿明），该军下辖第200师（戴）、第22师（廖）、第96师（余）和第38师（孙）。
> * 中国的第六军（指挥官：甘丽初），该军下辖第55师（陈）、第28师（？）和第49师（？）。
>
> 第200师正在前线，第五军的其余部队在缅甸北部，距后方几百英里。第六军被部署在中国和泰国的边境线上。
> 日本人迅速地向北推进，几乎包围了战线中部东吁的第200师。但日本人在向前推进时也暴露了他们自己，史迪威看到了一个反攻的机会。作为中国缅甸远征军总司令，他要求把部队在战线以北60英里铁路线上的彬马那集结起来。他特别要求杜聿明将军的第22师和第96师从北部挥师南下，开到彬马那地区，去解救第200师。中国的各个师如果分散在缅句各地，就会被各个击破；但如果他们集结起来投入战斗，就有可能阻挡住日本人的进攻，甚至可能重新夺取仰光。
> 这个计划有赖于两点：英国人在眉谬能够守住战线的西翼，中国人能够迅速完全地执行反攻命令。
> 然而，对于中国人来说，把各个师集结在作战地区进行反攻在增加了机会的同时也增加了危险。看来，无论史迪威用什么方法加以鼓励，中国的指挥机构也不愿意去进攻。在以后的两周里，史迪威发现，他的指挥权只是表面的权力，而不是实际上的权力。于是他决定飞回重庆，去同蒋介石讨论这个问题。

Friday the 13th. Alexander arrived. Very cautious. Long sharp nose. Rather brusque and yang ch'i [standoffish]. Let me stand around while waiting for Shang Chen to come. Uninterested when Shang did come. Astonished to find ME-mere me, a goddam American-in command of Chinese troops. "Extraordinary!" Looked me over as if I had just crawled out from under a rock.
2: 00 p.m. Brigadier Clark and Colonel Jones about maintenance. They agreed to do it. Also will repair ordnance and operating instruments. Damn nice of them. In fact, all the British are now co-operating. If Chiang K'ai-shek will only say "Go" we're off. The press is after me now. Dorn is keeping them off.
About midnight, Major Miller, from the governor's office, barged into my bedroom, woke me up and said General
Morris was in from India, and that he and General Alexander wanted to see me at 10: 00 in the morning at "Flagstaff House." Can you beat it? I wonder what those babies would have said if I had sent Dorn on a similar errand to them? It's just the superior race complex, for which they will pay dearly. The situation down front looked bad, so I radioed Chiang K'ai-shek over Hou's secret set, to release the 22nd and g6th Divisions to go to Pyinmana and back up the 200th.

13日，星期五。亚历山大①抵达。既谨小慎微，又极其鲁莽、冷漠。在等待商震的时候居然让我一个人站在那里。在商震来时无动于衷。商震惊奇地发现居然是我在指挥中国军队，一个该死的美国人。“妙极了！”他上下打量着我，好像我是刚刚从石头下面爬出来似的。
下午2点钟，与克拉克准将[时任美国陆军地面部队司令部代参谋长]和琼斯上校讨论军械保养问题。他们同意去做修理军械和操作设备的事情。这些东西的情况糟透了。事实上，现在所有的中国人都很合作。只要蒋介石说一声“走”，我们就完事大吉了。现在新闻界已经盯上我了。多恩正在设法让我避开他们。
大约在午夜时分，总督办公处的米勒少校闯进我的卧室，把我叫醒，说莫里斯将军已从印度来到这里，他和亚历山大将军想在上午10点钟同我在旗杆别墅见面。我想知道如果我派多恩到他们那里去干同样的事情，他们会说些什么？这完全是一种高人一等的变态心理，他们将为此付出高昂的代价。
前线的情况看来不妙，于是我通过侯的秘密电台给蒋介石拍了封电报，要求他允许22师和96师去彬马那增援200师。

①哈罗德·亚历山大爵士，陆军元帅，后来成为地中海所有盟国部队的司令官。

3月15日（上午9点）

Morris, Hutton, Alexander, at Flag- staff House. Told them the news. They were much relieved. Alexander now pleasanter. (Morris has talked to him.) They had the instructions out studying them. Alexander tried to joke about my stealing his Chinese troops. [He] wanted to wear some Chinese insignia. Sent word to Wavell and Brereton.... Asked for air support.
Alex says he has just 4,000 fighting men. Alex says he now perfectly understands and we will co-operate alongside each other.
Move of 22nd and g6th Divisions under way. Leading
elements here tomorrow. Tu came over at 5: 00. He had to shoot a man of the 55th Division at Lashio for hell-raising. I told him to keep it up. DC-3 crash at Kunming. General Dennys killed, on way to tell Chiang K'ai-shek to send more troops.
Got Tu over, went over plan, wrote order for Tu.

与莫里斯、赫顿和亚历山大在旗杆别墅。把这个消息告诉了他们。他们大大地松了一口气。亚历山大的举止现在令人轻松愉快。他们仔细地研究了那些命令。亚历山大想开个玩笑，说我偷走了他的中国军队。他想佩戴一些中国军队的标志。通知了韦维尔和布里尔顿··要求空中支援。
亚历山大说他仅有4000名战斗人员。并说他现在已完全释怀，我们将肩并肩地进行合作。
22师和96师已开始行动。先头部队将于明天到达这里。杜5点钟来访。他在腊戍枪毙了55师中一个胡作非为的人。我告诉他要保持振作。DC—3型飞机在昆明失事，丹尼斯将军遇难，他此行是想让蒋介石增派军队。
帮助杜恢复了常态，仔细检查了计划，写了给杜的命令。

3月19日

Had a night's sleep-first time since Calcutta. Woke up without feeling all was lost. At 11:00 saw Chiang K'ai-shek again. Stubborn bugger. But he gave in a bit. 22nd Division can go to Taungdwingyi and can support 200th or help British out of a mess if they lose Prome. [See map, page 57.] Under my command only, and only in emergency. It's to be morale mainly.

g6th Division must stay in Mandalay, but one division of Sixth Army will be sent to Maymyo. Later two more will go to border. In a month, if nothing happens, maybe we can take the offensive. (He wants to be sure it will be easy.) Again told me Fifth and Sixth must not be defeated, so I told him to send someone who could guarantee that, because I couldn't. In war, we'd have to do our best and take what came. He laughed. Said he had bowed in some part to my recommendations, but insisted he knew what he was talking about. Told him when fighting started, I would have to be free to act, and he agreed. Of course under the general restrictions of defensive attitude, one division in Mandalay, no British command, and help for British only in an emergency. It's pretty bad, but maybe it will get better. All I can do is try.
59 today. Very nice message from Marshall.
Q. Am I getting anywhere? A. Compared to two weeks ago, decidedly. Appointment as Chief of Staff,(Creation of)Joint Staff, and Commanding General of Fifth and Sixth Armies. Of course there are many restrictions, but not so many as at first. Continued butting is wearing down resistance. Repeated arguments are shaking Madame somewhat. (In fact she told me to keep it up.) And Ho Ying-ch'in, Pai Chung-hsi, Liu Fei, and Hsü Yung-ch'ang unanimously approved my argument. That might be considered a major victory. Even Chiang K'ai-shek has yielded on some points-he is sending more troops, he has released a division to Taungdwingyi, and I can even use it to help the British at Prome. He will consider an offensive if there is quiet, or a successful defense-after another month. The supply is arranged, the medical people are stirred up, and the British understand how they must work. The Chinese accept my status, which is close to a miracle, since it is the first time in modern history that a foreigner has commanded regular Chinese troops.


睡了整整一夜——自加尔各答以来的第一次。醒来时已没有那种失掉了一切的感觉。11点再次去见蒋介石。固执的家伙。但他稍微让了点步。22师可以开到东敦枝，去支援200师；或是在英国人失去眉谬时帮助他们摆脱困境。只能由我来指挥，而且只有在处于十分紧急的情况下。
96师必须留驻曼德勒，但第六军的一个师将被派往眉谬。此后另外两个师将被派到边境地区。如果不发生意外，也许在一个月里我们就能发动攻势。（他要确保能轻而易举地完成它。）他再次对我说，决不能让第五军和第六军吃败仗。于是我对他说，让他另外找一个能保证这一点的人来，因为我无法保证做到这一点。在战争中，我们必须竭尽自己的努力去干，并接受现实结果。他笑了。他说他同意我建议中的某些部分，但仍坚持他所谈论的事情。我告诉他，一旦战斗打响，我必须有行动的自由，他同意了。当然，我还要受到进攻上的一些限制，一个师在曼德勒，不允许英国人来指挥，只有在紧急情况下才能去帮助英国人。这糟透了。但情况也许会好转。我所能做的就是去试一试。
今天59岁了。马歇尔那里传来了非常好的消息。
问题：我的工作有成效吗？回答：与两周前相比，已取得了决定性进展。被任命为参谋长，第五军和第六军建立了联合参谋部，以我为指挥官。当然，还有许多限制，但已不像刚开始时那么多了。不断的争论已使对手慢慢败退下来。反复申诉自己的观点也使夫人的立场有了松动。（事实上，她还让我坚持下去。）何应钦、白崇禧、刘斐和徐永昌一致赞同我的观点。这应当被视为是一场重大胜利。甚至连蒋介石也在某些问题上做了让步——他将派遣更多的军队，他同意派一个师去东敦枝，我甚至可以用这个师来帮助在眉谬的英国人。如果再过一个月，防守取得成功，他将考虑进攻的问题。供给已安排好了，医务人员已发动起来，英国人必须知道他们应如何工作。中国人接受了我的地位，这几乎是个奇迹，一个外国人指挥中国的正规军，这在近代历史上还是第一次。
